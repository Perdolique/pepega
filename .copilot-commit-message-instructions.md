1. Use conventional commits format.

2. Begin the commit message with a single short (no more than 50 characters) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description in list format with fun emoji per each item that represents the change. Put emoji on the beginning of the text following the format: "-{one space}{emoji} {text}".

3. If packages were updated, then show every version bump as separate entry in the details. Like "workspace: package v1 -> v2" or similar.
