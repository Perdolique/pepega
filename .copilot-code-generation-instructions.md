Use exact comparisons without type casting: E.g.: `if (woof === undefined) {}` instead of `if (!woof) {}`

Always use curly braces for `if`, `switch` and `case`

Use English language in code comments

Use empty line before `return` statement

Do not support old browsers. Baseline 2024 should be fine.

Design should be responsive, mobile-first.

Design should support light and dark modes. Use `light-dark()` for that in CSS.

Colors should be in `oklch`.

Try to reduce amount of DOM elements if possible.

Do not use any CSS frameworks like Tailwind.

Use global variables from `src/lib/styles/app.css`
